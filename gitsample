this is a test file to practice git commands
<<<<<<< HEAD
following are git commands
git<>init<>localrepository - initiates a empty repository named as local repository
until u add/commit a file, no master will be created in the local repository and you can't see master, even if you type git branch you can't see any branch names

After your 1st commit a master will be created, this will be the main branch

git<>status   - this is used to see if any file is in workspace, staging area or in local repository
git<>add---- this is used to move file from woirkspace to staging area
git<>commit<>-m<>"commitmessage" - this is used to move file from staging area to local repository
git>?log - this is used to see log hgistory of commists
=======
creating empty repository git <>init<>repository
add anew file, add and commit, the a new branch called master will be created
everytime we edit, we need ato add and commit the files
git status is used to see if any file is ion workspace or in staging area or in gir repository

Now we have created a new branch called subbranch1 using command git branch newbranch name
switch to new branch from old bnranch ising command git chekout branch name
now if u edit a file in local repository, add and commit it, oit'll be stored in subbranch not in master branch

added a new tag to version called "this commit is in subbranch"
and edit a old file commit it then give a tag  after twocommits, the new tag 
old tag will have 1st commit, new tag will have next two commit entries
try now
hashlhs

Now we need to check for rever

Try once again for pull


once again we'll try git push

This is to practice pull
