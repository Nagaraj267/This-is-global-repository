this is a test file to practice git commands
following are git commands
git<>init<>localrepository - initiates a empty repository named as local repository
until u add/commit a file, no master will be created in the local repository and you can't see master, even if you type git branch you can't see any branch names

After your 1st commit a master will be created, this will be the main branch
